# Intel-Image-Classification-ResNet50V2
## Introduction:

This project aims to showcase the implementation and performance of the ResNet50v2 model on the Intel Image Classification dataset. The ResNet50v2 model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks. It is a variant of the original ResNet50V2 model with some modifications to the architecture that improve its accuracy and efficiency i.e. the accuracy on training data improved from 0.8724 to 0.9012 and 0.8810 to 0.9083 for test data.

## Datset:

The Intel Image Classification dataset consists of images belonging to 6 classes, including mountains, sea, and buildings. The dataset is widely used for benchmarking image classification models and has a balanced distribution of images across the classes.

## Model Used:

ResNet50V2
